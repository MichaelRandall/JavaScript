	//Lambda is an expression that is used as data. Meaning that the function is passed as an argument
	//to another function, returned as a value from a function, or assigned to variables or data structures.
	//Lambda passing an anonymous function as data to a higher order function
	
	//iife's are not lambda - 
	
	//example of object literal
	var myObj = {name:"mike",age:50};
